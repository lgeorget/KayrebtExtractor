* 1.0.1
	* Fix ISRA bug: functions generated by GCC ending with '.isra.(\d+)'
	have now a correct URL

* 2.0.0-rc1
        * Export source file and line information in graph so that
	Kayrebt::Viewer can take advantage of this to improve the visualization

	== version 2.0 never released ==

* 3.0.0-rc1
	* Change entirely the "attribute" mechanism
	Now, the plugin can add unrestricted attributes to the graphs using
	addGraphAttributes(key,value) and addNodeAttributes(node,key,value)
	No support for attributes lacking a default operator<<, nor for the
	categories yet but the API is ready for it.
