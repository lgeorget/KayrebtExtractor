* 1.0.1
	* Fix ISRA bug: functions generated by GCC ending with '.isra.(\d+)'
	have now a correct URL

* 2.0.0-rc1
        * Export source file and line information in graph so that
	Kayrebt::Viewer can take advantage of this to improve the visualization

	== version 2.0 never released ==

* 3.0.0-rc1
	* Change entirely the "attribute" mechanism
	Now, the plugin can add unrestricted attributes to the graphs using
	addGraphAttributes(key,value) and addNodeAttributes(node,key,value)
	No support for attributes lacking a default operator<<, nor for the
	categories yet but the API is ready for it.

* 3.0.0-rc2
	* Incorporate the configuration-defined categories in the new
	attributes API
	The format of the configuration file has changed a little. Now the
	categories of representations must be YAML maps. For example:

	categories:
	  1:
	    style: filled
	    fillcolor: yellow
	    bgcolor: blue
	  2:
	    bgcolor: green

	-- does not compile, sorry

* 3.0.0-rc3
	* Fix compilation issue due to the exporting of boost headers in the
	plugin code.
	* Fix the installation of the symlink to $(gcc -print-file-name=plugin)
	(by the way, this may be the bad way of doing it)
